The authors demonstrate that p300 binding is enriched at sites occupied by P3F, how does this compare with acetylation levels and chromatin accessibility at these sites? 
> Response: Using public data from the RH4 cell-line, we identified the profiles of acetylation (via H3K27ac ChIP-seq) and accessibility (via ATAC-seq) at the sites of p300 + P3F occupancy.
