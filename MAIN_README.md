# Updates to the RMS Project Paper
by Yaw Asante and Bhava Udhayakamar
July 2023
This repo contains the code used to create the figures and datasets requested by the reviewers of the Osman et al 2023 paper, submitted to Nature Communications.

### Issue 1
Activity from directly bound P3F target genes (within 500kb of P3F binding) vs indirect targets. 

### Issue 2
The authors only use an FDR cutoff in their analysis, but a cutoff taking into consideration the magnitude of the effect would be important. Moreover, separation into most sensitive and least sensitive genes combined with an analysis of the contextual nature of the P3F binding sites may reveal whether certain genes are more or less affected by the C793 mutation and possibly why.


### Issue 3
Acetylation Levels and Chromatin Accessibility at p300 binding sites

### Issue 4
The impact of P300/CBP degraders on H3K27ac, segregated by enhancer and promoter regions.

### Issue 5
3D genome looping at Pol2 sites strongly bound by P300 with and without P3F.

</p>
### Issue 6
CBP/P300 are central/core regulators of gene activation in cells. How expected are the results of the second part? Can the authors put more emphasis what’s going on outside PAX3-FOXO1 target regions and discuss more this.
