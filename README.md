# Response to Reviewer Comments on "PAX3-FOXO1 uses its activation domain to recruit CBP/P300 and shape RNA Pol2 cluster distribution"
by Yaw Asante and Bhava Udhayakumar
July 2023

This repo contains the code used to create the figures and datasets requested by the reviewers of the Asante et al 2023 paper, submitted to Nature Communications.

### Issue 1
Activity from directly bound P3F target genes (within 500kb of P3F binding) vs indirect targets.Â 
(Code provided, data included as part of Supplementary Table 2, model plot included below)

</p>
(Genes in direct: PIPOX, FRG2B, DBX1, PERCC1, CDH4, KIF3B, FGF8, FOXF1, FENDRR, EFNB2, FGFR2)

### Issue 2
Separation into C793 mutation dependent and partially dependent gene sets combined with an analysis of the contextual nature of the P3F binding site motifs.
(Output from HOMER provided, no meaningful differences)

### Issue 3

</p>

### Issue 4
The impact of P300/CBP degraders on RH5 H3K27ac, segregated by enhancer and promoter regions (compared to impact on RH4 Pol2).

### Issue 5
3D genome looping at Pol2 sites strongly bound by P300 with and without P3F.

</p>

### Issue 6
Changes in RH4 gene expression due to dCBP1, split across genes near and distal from p300 enhancers.
