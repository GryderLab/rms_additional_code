For genes which have P3F bound in a nearby enhancer, compare these P3F peaks to P3F peaks that are not near a C793 sensitive gene.Â  Are the motifs at that peak different?
> Response: Using HOMER, we identified and plotted the binding site motifs of those peaks associated with dependent genes and those which were not.
